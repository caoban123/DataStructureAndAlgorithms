# LeetCode Data Structures Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems focused on **Data Structures**.  
The goal is to practice and master different data structures while building clean, efficient, and readable code.

## Structure
- Each `.py` file solves one specific problem.
- File names are based on the problem name (e.g., `linked_list_cycle.py` for the "Linked List Cycle" problem).
- Solutions are grouped by data structure type:
  - **Array**
  - **Linked List**
  - **Stack & Queue**
  - **Hash Table**
  - **Tree & Graph**
  - **Heap / Priority Queue**
  - **Other**

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LeetCode.git
